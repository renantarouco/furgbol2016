The referee box is aimed pushing the small size league towards full
autonomy with little physical human contact with the robots. The
referee box, which has been long talked about in the small size
league, is a PC program designed to provide a GUI interface to the
assistant referee and UDP packets to the two competing teams. The
referee box will keep a record of the timeouts, time remaining, score
and penalties.
